# Project 1 - *Junior Wordle*

Submitted by: **Maria Perez**

**Junior Wordle** is an app that uses a random secret word and the user has to guess
and the user gets hints by the changing of the color of the letter if it is correct, 
close, or incorrect. The user can add and delete letters.

Time spent: **6:30** hours spent in total

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

Some challenges that I encountered while building this app were understanding the technical terms for certain feautures like closures since that was something that I was not fully exposed to. Understanding what the instructions were asking and making sure that everything matched was a fun challenge but a challenge nonetheless.
